## Getting Started

These instructions highlighted in this section will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment section for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system

### Prerequisites

The prerequisites are list of software or frameworks that would be required to setup the application. Also, the steps to install them should be documented too.
Example: jdk, .net framework, nodeJs, intellij etc.

### Dependencies

Dependencies are list of external applications/platforms that the software development largely depends on for it to function.
Example: eBillsPay depends on NIP, Authserve as a dependency for most APIs

### Setup

This section should describe the step-by-step guide on how the application is setup on a local machine/development environment.
